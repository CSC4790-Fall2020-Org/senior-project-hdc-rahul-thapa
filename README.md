2. [dataset](#dataset) Info
3. [projection](#projection) Module
4. [testing](#testing) Module
5. [retraining](#retraining) Module

## Requirements

The main requirements are listed below:
* Python 3.6
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* OpenCV 4.2.0

## Dataset

The link to these datasets are given below:

* MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
* Face Images: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/CMU+Face+Images 

We have also provided a data folder with MNIST dataset for ease of use.  

**Note: For right now, you will only work with file HD_MNIST_version_2_retraining_framework.py. All the modules are in the same file. In fact, one module is directly being called inside the other. However, in future, the steps below will require separate files for each module. Also, it will be agnostic to the dataset if it is in similar domain.**
