We have also provided a data folder with MNIST dataset for ease of use.  


## HD Projection
**In this section, you need to work with prunning.py file and Function.py file**

### Steps for Projection
1. Inside prunning.py file, set a path (line 7) to the dataset you intend to train on.


## HD Testing
**In this section, you need to work with main2.py and Function.py file inside src folder**

### Steps for Testing
1. Inside main2.py, set the path variable (around line 14) for the dataset you want to train on.


## HD Retraining
**In this section, you need to work with testing.py and Function.py file inside src folder**

### Steps for Retraining
1. Open the testing.py file, and set the path (around line 10) to the image folder you want to test on.
